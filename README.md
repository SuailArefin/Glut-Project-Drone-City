# Glut-Project-Drone-City
This project is an interactive and automated animation created using GLUT and C++. The simulation depicts a modern cityscape designed on a 2D platform but enriched with 3D-like visual effects to create depth and realism.
Key Features:
Drone Control

The user can interact with the simulation by controlling a drone.
The drone's movement is responsive to user input, allowing it to fly across the city, navigate around buildings, and explore the animated environment.
Automated Animations

Buildings: The city is populated with tall, modern buildings that create a vibrant urban skyline.
Water Canal: A central canal adds to the city's charm, featuring dynamic water animations.
Train: A train traverses the city, moving along its tracks in a continuous automated animation.
Boat: Boats glide across the water canal, complementing the city's bustling ambiance.

The project demonstrates creative use of OpenGL and GLUT in a C++ environment, blending user interactivity with pre-scripted animations. It serves as a showcase for animation, simulation, and rendering techniques in graphics programming.
